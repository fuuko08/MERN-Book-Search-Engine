# Book Search Engine Starter Code

  [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

## Description

The app was built using the MERN Stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server and GraphQL API. I also created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. App is deployed with Heroku.
